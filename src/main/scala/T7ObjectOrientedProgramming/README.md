## My notes

In a class definition there are only certain kinds of clauses you can use.
1. Method - creates a behaviour based on the instance
2. Instantiation variables - given at instantiation
3. Instance variables - defined internally to track instant state (essentially?)
4. Class variables - defined internally to the class to track class state 

A class with no local state is an object, there is no need to create multiple instances of it. 

Object-oriented programming is a solution to complexity.

Computer programming is dealing with two main ideas processes (computation) and data (storage)

Processes: 
* Machine instructions
* Formulas 
* Procedures (functions)
* Structured programming ?

Data:
* Memery cells (hardware)
* Variables (global state)
* Data structures (things actually in the computer)
* Abstract data types (data structures that arent a direct mapping onto hardware)
